# ronan
Ronan is a virtual assistant built using Python. It uses several libraries such as pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, speech recognition for voice input, and webbrowser for opening websites.

  To use Ronan, the user can activate it by saying "Hey Ronan" followed by a command. The following are the commands that Ronan can execute:  Open YouTube: If the user says "Hey Ronan, open YouTube", Ronan will use the webbrowser library to open the YouTube website.  Search on Google: If the user says "Hey Ronan, search for 'query' on Google", Ronan will use the webbrowser library to open the Google website and perform a search for the user's query.  Open Mails: If the user says "Hey Ronan, open my emails", Ronan will use the webbrowser library to open the user's default email client.  Stop Ronan: If the user says "Hey Ronan, stop", Ronan will stop listening to further commands and exit the program.  Ronan is designed to be expandable, and new functionalities can be easily added by writing additional code for the desired functionality.
